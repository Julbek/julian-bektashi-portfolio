                Julian has a strong background in all things design, all things
                Imagery, and all things sound. That said, if you called him a
                “visual person” or, heaven fordbid, "left-brained", he would
                promptly let you know that he’s also a “scientific
                method-evidence-based guy”, that has a keen interest in technical
                stuff, and that the best creative ideas are the result of intense
                interaction between the two brain hemispheres.
              </p>

              <p>
                Julian has studied architecture, where, among other things, has developed a solid design thinking and
                {' '}
                a good sense of seeing the “forest for the trees”. His work experience includes architecture, CGI, graphic design and photography.
              </p>

              <p>

                His work ethic is strong enough to impress clients and worry doctors.
