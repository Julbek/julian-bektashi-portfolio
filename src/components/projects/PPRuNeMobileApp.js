                The Professional Pilots Rumor Network, or PPRuNe, is an Internet
                forum catering to airline pilots and other professionals in the
                aviation industry
              </p>

              <p>
                PPRuNe is the most popular site in its field, with more than
                250,000 registered members, many of them professional pilots. It
                is sometimes at the centre of debates about aviation issues in
                the new and commercial pilots often share insights and
                perspectives about aviation mishaps, sometimes eyewitness
                accounts

                The goal of this presentation was to develop from scratch a new
                digital product while being considerate of the history and
                identity of the community.

                This logo is central to the forum's identity, however, as part
                of developing the product, a restyling of the logo was also
                performed in order to boost the app's image and help it stand
                out as an all-around well-designed product.

                        After the conceptual part of defining a solid information architecture and a restyling of the logo,
                        the next step was drafting a prototype. It started s a low-fi draft with the basic building
                        blocks and colour palette. Then,  after some experimentation and constant revaluation,
                        progressed into its final high-fidelity form.

                    <p> Part of the presentation was also designing custom icons.
                        They emerged from a minimalistic reinterpretation of the most
                        familiar and commonly used symbols in UI design.
                        There was one exception in terms of design convention though:
                        the settings menu is represented by an array of buttons inspired
                        by the cockpit panels.
