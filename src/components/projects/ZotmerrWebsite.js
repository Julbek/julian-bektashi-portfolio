            Zotmerr.art: Bare (digital) Art
          </h1>

            Zotmerr is a personal digital art project initiated in 2021 and which I
            stopped a few months later and which sooner or later I will kick
            start again (or not).
          </p>

          <p className="text-p">
            I developed the website from scratch on hard coded html, css and
            plain javascript . In terms of design, I wanted it to be as
            straightforward as possible, almost devoid of UI
            components, and let the art, structure and interactions with the art
            pieces themselves to make up the website.

          </p>

          <p className="text-p">
            Have a look at the <a href="https://zotmerr.art/" target="_blank">website</a> if you're not in big hurry!
